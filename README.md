# Spring Boot Microservices with Eureka and Load Balancer

This project is a demonstration of microservices architecture implemented using Spring Boot, Eureka for service discovery, and a load balancer for efficient request distribution. Microservices have become increasingly popular due to their scalability, resilience, and agility in modern software development.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot:** Leveraging the simplicity and convention-over-configuration approach of Spring Boot for rapid development and deployment of microservices.
- **Microservices Architecture:** The project is structured as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business functionality.
- **Eureka for Service Discovery:** Eureka, a Netflix OSS component, is employed as a service registry for locating services dynamically. It allows services to register themselves and discover other services without hardcoding their locations.
- **Load Balancer:** A load balancer is incorporated to evenly distribute incoming requests among multiple instances of a service, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and optimal resource utilization.
- **RESTful APIs:** Communication between microservices is facilitated through RESTful APIs, enabling seamless interaction and data exchange.
- **Scalability and Resilience:** The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of services based on demand. Additionally, it ensures resilience by handling failures gracefully and maintaining service availability.
- **Containerization:** Optionally, Docker containers can be used to package each microservice along with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Eureka (Service Discovery)
- Load Balancer (e.g., Ribbon, Zuul)
- RESTful APIs
- Docker (Optional)

## Purpose

This project aims to showcase the implementation of microservices architecture using Spring Boot along with essential components like Eureka for service discovery and a load balancer for effective load distribution. It serves as a learning resource and a foundation for building scalable, resilient, and cloud-native applications.
